# TTInternational Version 2

This project was a mock website for the fictional rescue service organization "Trauma Team International" from the game Cyberpunk 2077. 
It was originally intended to be a bleak representation of the world in the game, but has since been reimagined as a more cheerful pet products shop.

## The website is built using a combination of:


-HTML


-CSS


-JavaScript // jQuery


-PHP


-MySQL/MariaDB



This is the second version of the project, with a major focus on creating a more vibrant color palette and a more polished overall look. The website is designed to simulate an e-commerce platform, where users can browse and shop for different types of products. Still unsure if this will be set up live but regardless feel free to clone it.
Features a cleanear layout, making it easy for users to navigate and find the information they need. The use of more upbeat colors and playful illustrations helps to create a positive and inviting atmosphere, which is in contrast to the darker tone of the original version and it's also something I want to work more towards to so I can feel more at ease when outside my usual zone of confort.

Overall I'm having a whole lot fun with this, a whole lot of raccoons are to be expected.

Soon you'll be able to run this locally once I complete the database for it. I'm running this through xampp as localhost:3307
